# Demo

This is a super quick project to demonstrate the usage of typescript, react, redux, thunk and material UI.

Todo/Problems

- Lack of tests
- Poor component / Store naming
- I would like to re organize the types eg Dictionary shouldn't be in src/store/apiCard/types.ts

The design is a little funky because I intend to fork this project to be a backend CMS for another project.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
